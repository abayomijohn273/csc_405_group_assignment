Thereafter, a formal meeting was fixed to formally start the club in April 1995 with the attendance of 6. The initial focus at this early stage was to identify potential members and bring them to the fold. Before year 2000, the club had the following as members.

ratification to accomodate more coporate and reliable members as advised by our amiable
Club Adviser Hon Nurudeen Olaleye .The club success story should also be tagged to the

supported the club through her first democratic Elections in 1995 which produced
Folk Sodiya as her first President in 1999.

seen as a major promotion compared to when MEMBERS residence were used as meeting points.
The first Anniversary of the club was held in December 1997 where 5 members were inducted bringing
the number to 9.Needless to say, these crucial additions brought the ever needed strength which
promptly culminated to having the first club constitution, comprising her
Motto( TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL..) Slogan/Chant ( Many Folks !One Fold ( All still used till date ).
The climax of the success tracks came in Nov 2007 when the club was duly registered with the
Nigeria enabling authority.
